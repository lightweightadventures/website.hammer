ABOUT
This project is about setting out to see the natural world, and the people who live in it close to nature.
It is about teaching our children the right things — a love and respect for our planet, our bodies (food/exercise) and our minds.
It is about living deliberately, simply, kindly, slowly, peacefully.
Lovers of simplicity, adventure, and deliberate living, in a manic consumer world, we are literally Sailing for Sanity.


SLOGAN IDEAS (who is S4S for?)
* initially it is for me, for us, and for our family to touch base and see what we are up to.
* it is to concept test some ideas for potential services that we may be able to offer in the future as part of a deliberate lifestyle:
  -- photography
  -- writing (for magazines, and ebooks:foraging/making it pay/what boat/home education/simplicity afloat)†
  -- boat building
  -- yacht deliveries, and sail training
* the slogan will come with the services when we have focussed on what we can offer.
